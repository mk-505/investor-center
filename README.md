# 📈 Investor Center

**Investor Center** is a full-stack AI-powered platform that provides real-time stock predictions and intelligent financial insights. It combines deep learning models and a natural language chatbot to help users make smarter investment decisions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **📊 Stock Price Forecasting**  
  Enter any stock ticker and view forward-looking price trends generated by pre-trained LSTM and Bi-directional LSTM models.

- **🧠 AI Financial Chatbot**  
  Get answers to company-specific questions and market analysis using a powerful natural language model.

- **📈 Interactive Visuals**  
  Forecasts are displayed through dynamic, responsive graphs for easy interpretation.

- **🔍 Dual Model Support**  
  Toggle between LSTM and Bi-LSTM models to compare predictions and insights.

---

## 🧠 AI Models

The platform uses two deep learning models for time series forecasting:

- `lstm_model.weights.h5`  
- `bi_stacked_concat_model.weights.h5`  

Both are trained on historical stock data to predict future price movements.

---

## 🤖 Chatbot

The chatbot is powered by the `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1` model via the Hugging Face API. It understands financial context and can answer queries like:

- “What’s the outlook for AAPL this quarter?”
- “Summarize the latest news on Tesla.”
- “What are analysts saying about MSFT?”
